## Problem 1

```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

## Problem 2

```{r}

# In the accel dataset, there are 3 integer variables: week, day_id, and minute. There are 2 factor variables: day and day_type (weekend/weekday variable), and activity level variable is numeric.
# There are 50,400 observations and 6 variables.

# There's less activity between 0 and about 300 minutes. There are spikes of activity at different points of the day, particularly on Friday at around 1200-1300 minutes.
