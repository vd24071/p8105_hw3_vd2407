## Load tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

## Problem 1

```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

## Problem 2

```{r}
accel = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    day_type = ifelse(
      day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday",
      "Weekend", "Weekday"),
    week = as.integer(week),
    day_id = as.integer(day_id)) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.double, as.numeric) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, day_type, activity_1:activity_1440)

# In the accel dataset, there are 2 integer variables: week and day_id, 2 character variables: day and day_type, and the 1440 activity levels by minute (activity_) are numeric.
# There are 35 observations and 1444 variables.
  
```

```{r}
accel = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    day_type = ifelse(
      day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday",
      "Weekend", "Weekday"),
    week = as.integer(week),
    day_id = as.integer(day_id)) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.double, as.numeric) %>%  
  mutate(total_activity =
           rowSums(across(c(activity_1:activity_1440)))) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, day_type, total_activity, activity_1:activity_1440)
